# 📖 | Concept
Mininja is a flash-game inspired by a former project, [Koffre](https://github.com/Bouncii/Koffre), another flash-game made in 6h during the [Nuit Du Code](https://www.nuitducode.net/) in high school.
The initial idea was to develop my skills with `Godot` and `GDscript` while starting from something I already knew a little bit about.  

For now, the game is pretty simple : you control a tiny character in differents levels who is trying to avoid getting caught. All of the enemies are using light in order to patrol different sections
of each level. But the catch is that the movements are "*grid-based*". The game also have a turn system where the player and enemies move each one after the other, so you have to predict where the
safe tile are in order to success.
